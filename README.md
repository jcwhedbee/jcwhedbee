- 👋 Hi, I’m @jcwhedbee
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering as well as entrepreneurship
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engineering with html, css, and javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different things, and get more familiar with coding (especially in web design)
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm not sure, I'm just doing this because my Coding Bootcamp said to make a GitHub account.
